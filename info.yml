      Mapping of original engine command names, as seen from running "tank"
      command, to new command names.

      This is to make running tank CMD much more friendly than the default,
      auto-generated "short_name" from the various apps.
      
      As an example, we can define it once in "project" as a YAML anchor and
      then have other contexts use the same "replaced_commands_names" settings:

        settings.tk-shell.project:
          replaced_commands_names: &replacements
            old_name_from_tank_command: new_name
            katana_4.0.2: katana
            publish: publish_in_place

        settings.tk-shell.asset:
          replaced_commands_names: *replacements

        settings.tk-shell.shot_step:
          replaced_commands_names: *replacements
